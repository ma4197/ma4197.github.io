# Introduction

Welcome to my page! My name is Mayuri Albal and I am 
a graduate student at Mailman School of Public Health. Currently, I am in the Epidemiology department with a certificate in Global Health. My background is in cognitive psychology,
but having the opportunity to merge this with Epidemiology on a global scale has been a large part of my coursework. There is information regarding my previous experiences as well as links to my sites!
